# Double Pendulum 
The motion of the double pendulum illustrates a high sensitivity to initial conditions. To the naive observer, the motion may appear "random" and "unpredictable".  
We show a derivation of the differential equations of motion for the double pendulum in order to validate its determinism. Following this, we numerically solve the equations for a particular set of conditions, and plot the solutions to explore the theoretical behavior of the system. These results are available ```double_pendulum_notebook.ipynb```.
In an additional engineering project, a double pendulum model was designed and 3D printed. For those interested in this task, design files are available under the ```MODEL``` directory.  
The overall goal of this project is to boost understanding of chaotic systems.
